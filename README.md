# Micro Bundle Adjustment ðŸŒ±
Getting into bundle adjustment solvers can be hard.
To make it easier, I have made a very basic pure Pytorch implementation, useful for teaching/learning.
Despite being less than 100 lines of code, it can handle 10^6 3D points with ease, due to utilizing sparsity and GPU.

# Features

# TODO List
- [ ] Example with residual function
- [ ] Generalize implementation to K-views
- [ ] Clean up and document code


# Usage
